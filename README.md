## 📌 Project Overview
This project is a simple **Java-based image processing tool** that performs:

- Conversion of an image to **grayscale**
- **Brightness enhancement**
- Saving processed output images

It demonstrates fundamental **pixel manipulation**, usage of **BufferedImage**, and file handling in Java.

## ▶️ How to Run

1. Open **terminal / PowerShell** inside the `src` folder.
2. Compile the Java file:


3. Run the program:

4. Output files will be generated in the **src folder**:
   - `output_gray.jpg`
   - `output_bright.jpg`

## 📝 Features

### ✔ Grayscale Conversion
Converts the input image into grayscale using Java’s `BufferedImage.TYPE_BYTE_GRAY`.

### ✔ Brightness Enhancement
Increases pixel brightness by fixed intensity while ensuring values remain within the 0–255 limit.

### ✔ File Handling
Reads input image and writes processed images using `ImageIO`.
